# botnetbeta

(very) early proof of concept of an HTTP based botnet.

TODO
  DNS Tunneling
  Self signed SSL Certs
  Creating Get & POST requests through java arrays
  Anti-debugging techniques (obfuscation, fast-flux DNS, checking for hex values such as /CC in runtime enviroment)
  LOTS of client side work
